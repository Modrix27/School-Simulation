# School-Simulation
A program that simulates a school.
The program does the job by itself, but it still takes some initial information from the mySchool text file, where the school, subjects, students and teachers are created. You can add more by yourself, but the program is made in a way in which you just have to choose how many days to simulate. Everything is commented anyways.
